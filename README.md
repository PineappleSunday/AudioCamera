Developer: C.RUNNION
Board: NUCLEO-F401RE STM32
Language: C
Description: Code here is interfaceing an STM32 with a INMP441 using I2S, and utilizing the STM DMA method. 
Code will generate an output for a L/R audio stream, but if there is only one device, a single stream will be populated, namely the left audio source.
